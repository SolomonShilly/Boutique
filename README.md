# Inventory Management System
This project implements a simple inventory management system for a retail store. The system allows customers to view available products place orders and view total sales.

- `price`: the price of the product
- `stock`: the number of items available for sale

## Features

- Ability for customers to place orders
- Updates stock levels and calculates total sales
- Records orders in a text file for future reference

## Usage
- Clone the repository
- Run the boutique.py file
